The params.phThe params.php file exists in this directory. So it contains the real password for the database,
the file didn't push to the repogitory. I hope you understand I mean.

The application of the room1 expects the following information in the params.php file.
Of course, the dbPassword's value is not real and you should replace it with your real one.
Also take cate of the unix_socket in the dbDSN variable.

$dbUser = 'web_survey';
$dbPassword = 'qqqqqqqq';
$dbDSN = 'mysql:unix_socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock;dbname=survey_db;';
